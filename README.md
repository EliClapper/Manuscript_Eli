 Manuscript with Reproducible Workflow

 This manuscript is a miniversion of my thesis.
 It is mini in the sense that I do not calculate all text features (6 instead of 96) or use all algorithms that I would in the complete version (5 instead of 8).
 The Results and Discussion section are also shortened to only include the essential information.
 I edited this manuscript so that this does not show, altough the introduction talks about overfitting which is with 6 features on 970 observations not really a problem. If you are interested in my full thesis regarding the subject, please let me know and I will send it your way as soon as it is finished.
